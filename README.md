# About Auto DND On Game
This is a BetterDiscord plugin that automatically enables DO NOT DISTURB (Others option available) mode when your activity is set to Playing a game. It will automatically disable DND(Others) mode when stopped showing the game activity. This plugin is useful for those who want to focus on the game and don't want to be disturbed by notifications.


I know plugin's code is kind of messy, but it works. I will try to improve it in the future. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

# About Auto DND On Game
This BetterDiscord plugin automatically enables **Do Not Disturb** (other options available) mode when your activity is set to "Playing a game." It will automatically back to **Online** when the game activity is no longer displayed. This plugin is useful for those who want to focus on the game and don't want to be disturbed by notifications.
